<h1>Course Description</h1>

<p>
<b>Description of Course Content: </b>

Object-oriented  concepts  and  application.  Object-oriented  program  design and  implementation  using  Java  with  basic  software  development  process  management  and  version  control.  Additional  topics  may  include  graphical  user  interfaces,  collection  classes,  templates,  reflection,  reusability,  and  concurrency.  Projects  involve  extensive  software  design  and  programming.
</p><p>

</p><p>


<b> Student Learning Outcomes:</b>

</p><ul>
<li>Object-Oriented  Theory:  Encapsulation,  inheritance,  and  polymorphism
</li><li>Object-Oriented  Design:  UML  and  patterns
</li><li>Input  and  Output:  Files,  keyboards,  streams,  and  exception  handling
</li><li>Using  Application  Programming  Interfaces  (API)  and  libraries
</li><li>Command  Line  Interfaces  (CLI)  and  Graphical  User  Interfaces  (GUI)
</li></ul>




<hr>

<h1>Assignments</h1>

<p>


    There will be several programming assignments in this course.  All assignments are completion grades and will have equal weight.
  </p><ul>
  
  </li><li>
  All assignments must be submitted via Canvas.
   </li><li>
  If you make multiple submissions to Canvas for the same assignment, only the latest submission will be graded.
  </li><li>
  After you submit your solutions, you should download them and make sure that you submitted the correct files. Every semester, several students ask for leniency, claiming that they did the assignment, but accidentally submitted the wrong files. These claims are often legitimate, but, unfortunately, no grade leniency will be accorded to such claims. It is each student's responsibility to doublecheck their submissions.
  </li><li>
  If, for whatever reason, you cannot submit on Canvas, e-mail your solution to the instructor and ALL teaching assistants, from your UTA account, BEFORE the submission deadline. This will serve as proof that you did the work. You still have to offer a very convincing explanation as to why you were not able to submit on Canvas.
  </li></ul>
  
  Students are allowed to work with fellow CSE 1325 students on the assignments. At the same time, learning to solve problems on your own is the most important practice for the midterm and final exams.
  
  <hr>




  <h1>
    Quizzes
    
    </h1>
    
    There will be several quizzes in this course.  They will be given online on Canvas during class time-you MUST have a webcam to take them.  All quizzes will have equal weight.  No make-up quizzes will be offered without some sort of documentation.  If you miss a quiz for some documented reason, you must let me know within 3 days the retake plan-if you wait longer, no retake will be offered. <br><br>

<h1>
Project

</h1>

This will be discussed later in the semester.

<hr>

<h1>Attendance Policy</h1>

At The University of Texas at Arlington, taking attendance is not required. Rather, each faculty member is free to develop his or her own methods of evaluating students' academic performance, which includes establishing course-specific policies on attendance. As the instructor of this section, I will follow the following attendance policy:

Attendance is mandatory for exams (midterms and final), but NOT for lectures. Attendance in lectures will NOT be used in calculating the semester grade. However, students are responsible for the material covered in the lectures. The instructor and teaching assistants will NOT honor requests to fill students in on what they missed in class, unless the absence was justified by an emergency.

<p>

Attendance is required for exams and quizzes. Absences for exams and quizzes will only be excused for medical or other emergencies, in strict adherence with UTA policy. All emergencies must be reported as early as possible and <strong>documented in writing</strong>. No make-up exams or quizzes will be given.
<strong>If a student has a religious holiday or event, they MUST let me know before the exam or quiz. No make-ups will be allowed after if I was not informed.</strong>

</p><p>

Transportation problems (e.g., flat tires) will NOT be considered a valid excuse for missing exams. To ensure attendance, plan to arrive to class well in advance, and have backup transportation plans available.

</p><p>

While UT Arlington does not require instructors to take attendance in their courses, the U.S. Department of Education requires that the University have a mechanism in place to mark when Federal Student Aid recipients "begin attendance in a course." UT Arlington instructors will report when students begin attendance in a course as part of the final grading process. Specifically, when assigning a student a grade of F, faculty report the last date a student attended their class based on evidence such as a test, participation in a class project or presentation, or an engagement online via Canvas. This date is reported to the Department of Education for federal financial aid recipients.



</p><hr>


<h1>
Class Participation
</h1>

Class participation is optional, and will not be considered for the course grade. At the same time, students are highly encouraged to participate, by asking questions, as well as answering questions by the instructor. Class participation can be an important resource for students who have difficulty understanding any part of the course material.



<hr>

<h1>Grading</h1>

<p>

Assignment scores and exam scores are converted to letter grades based on the following scale:

</p><ul>
<li>
A: 	90%
</li><li>
B: 	80%
</li><li>
C: 	70%
</li><li>
D: 	60%
</li><li>
F: 	below 60%.
</li></ul>

The instructor reserves the right to lower these thresholds, based on the distribution of scores and the degree of difficulty of the assignments and exams.

<p>

At the end of the semester, the course grade will be computed based on the following weights:<strong>(DO NOT ASK ME TO CURVE-IF EVEN ONE STUDENT ASKS ME TO DO THIS, THEN I 100% WILL NOT DO SO)</strong>

</p><ol>

  <li> Homework 5%
  
  </li><li> Quizzes  75%  (15% each)
  
  </li><li> Project 20%  
  
  </li></ol>

<p>



</p><p>

Any request for re-grading (for an assignment or midterm exam) must be made within 5 days of receipt of that grade. Any request for re-grading the final exam must be made within 3 days of receipt of that grade. Re-grading can lead to a higher or lower grade, depending on grading errors that are discovered.

</p><p>

IMPORTANT: It should be clear to every student that course grades will depend EXCLUSIVELY on the above grading criteria. Students should not request nor expect any other factor to be considered in computing the course grade. For example, factors that will NOT be considered are: need of a better grade to keep financial aid, to stay in the program, or to graduate. Students are expected to carefully monitor their own performance throughout the semester and seek guidance from available sources (including the instructor) if they are concerned about their performance and the course grade that they will earn.

</p><p>



</p><hr>

<h1>
Withdrawals
</h1>

The university withdrawal policy will be strictly adhered to. Up to the initial withdrawal date, all students will receive a W. After that date, the grade will be determined by the student's current average, and a WF or WP assigned as appropriate.

<p>

</p><hr>

<h1>
Expectations for Out-of-Class Study
</h1>


Beyond the time required to attend each class meeting, students enrolled in this course should expect to spend an additional minimum of 10 hours per week of their own time in course-related activities, including reading required materials, completing assignments, solving practice questions, and preparing for exams. More time may be needed for people having difficulties understanding the material. People with relatively weak mathematical background are expected to have more difficulties understanding the material, and to need more out-of-class study time.

<p>

</p><hr>

<h1>Emergency Exit Procedures</h1>

Should we experience an emergency event that requires us to vacate the building, students should exit the room and move toward the nearest exit:
<ul>
<li> Safely and calmly exit the classroom.

</li><li> After exiting the door turn right, and walk to the nearest exit.
</li></ul>

When exiting the building during an emergency, one should never take an elevator but should use the stairwells. Faculty members and instructional staff will assist students in selecting the safest route for evacuation and will make arrangements to assist handicapped individuals.
