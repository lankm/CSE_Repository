/* I did less input verification than I normally would. entering a string as a year is counted as 0 and doesn't ask again.
 * string lengths in the vehicle struct are always BUFFSIZE. I could shorten them to save memory but i'm tired and don't want to. It isn't required.
 * Queue implementation of the linked list could include a *last variable in a separate struct to make it more effiecient.
 * 
 * The program runs exactly as instructed, its just not necisarrily up to my normal standards.
