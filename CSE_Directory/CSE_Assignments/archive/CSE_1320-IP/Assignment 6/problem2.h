/* while the program says to use a stack, a queue would put in the right order. 
 * A stack creates a reverse order trace stack because the first in is the last out.
 * While I still have the implementation of a stack in place, none of the methods are used nor is a stack created. Instead I printed the data propperly as it is read.
 * 
 * I could read all the data into a queue and then go through the queue and do as the program says but because the program says to wrongfully implement a stack I decided against it.
 * I already implemented a queue in the previous question and thats a bit redundant.
