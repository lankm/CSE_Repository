B. Bandwidth = <u>1kHz</u>

C. Nyquist Sampling Frequency = <u>2kHz</u>


## D
You have a system that can sample an analog signal into discrete samples at a sampling frequency of 100 kHz.

1.  - Q: What is the maximum signal bandwidth you can sample without loss of signal information and allow for perfect signal reconstruction?
    - A: <u>The maximum signal bandwidth allowed would be 50 kHz. This is because the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem says that a signal can be completely reconstructed if the sample frequency is twice the bandwidth. 50 kHz * 2 = 100 kHz.</u>

<br>

2.  - Q: If the signal is real and has a minimum frequency of 0 Hz, what is the largest frequency component that the signal can contain and still meet the Nyquist sampling criteria?
    - A: <u>Similar to the answer above, the largest frequency component can be up to 50 kHz. With a minimum of 0 Hz and a maximum of 50 kHz the bandwidth would be 50 kHz which implies a minimum Nyquist Sampling Frequency of 100 kHz.</u>
