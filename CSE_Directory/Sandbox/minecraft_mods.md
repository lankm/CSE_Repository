# Minecraft Mods

## Overview

There are thousands or even tens of thousands of minecraft mods available. These range from small mods that tweak a part of the game that only occurs in the rarest of scenarios to mods that completly overhaul the game as it is. Additionally there are different mods made for the different mod loaders. While most big mods are on both or at least have a port, the choice of mod loader can be just as important as the mods themselves.

The focus of this mod list is to improve vanilla minecraft in a way that maximizes the potential of what minecraft can do while not deviating away from the vanilla feel. Additionally these mods are focused towards the survival aspect of the game with an emphasis on balence for hardcore play.

## Mod loader: Quilt

This choice is made to take advantage of the vast perfomance mods from the Fabric mod loader while additionally utilizing the mods that are quilt specific. As such there are some core mods that can not be gone without.

## API and Config Libraries

As with any software development, in order to facilitate the development of meaningful features, common libraries reduce the amount of work a single developer is required to do. Additionally due to the existence of multiple mod loaders for minecraft, there are extra libraries due to ports from one loader to an other.

## Player Interaction, Movement and View

As with any other game, how the player is implemented contributes a lot to the game. Vanilla minecraft shows the first person view as a 2D hand; this can be improved. Many additional features can be added to give a better sense of realism.

Additionally how the player feels when they move and look around the world is just as important. Limiting some features like sitting to only a couple corners of the game limits the freedom of the player.
